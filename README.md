Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I want to discuss more about the search bar, I want to see if there is a better way to implement it or how I could maybe expand on it so that it can search all movies instead of just movies on a certain page. 
2. I'm interested on how to put a table view and collection view together so that you could have a similar movies at the bottom.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I faced the most challenge so far with the search bar. Since I am not too familliar with Objective C, I wasn't too sure on how to isolate the movie titles to make it so that you can search by title. 
I was able to figure it out by getting help from the internet. 
I also faced issues with the loading screen because I wasn't aware of how things ran concurrently with each other.
